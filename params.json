When you're tired of working on it for now, go ahead and move on, try some more new things—\r\n\t4. Go ahead and validate it, see if it has any errors\r\n\t5. Go ahead and load it into the public_html area on your MUSites server, and see what it looks like\r\n\t6. Load your file into Canvas when you're satisfied with it!\r\n\r\n## MONDAY:\r\n- Reading due\r\n- Chapter 2 - Web Design\r\n- Response due before class—3 parts\r\n\t+ What squares with my beliefs?\r\n\t+ Triangle—three points I want to remember\r\n\t+ A question circling my mind\r\n\r\n## WEDNESDAY: \r\n- \"About Me\" Page due\r\n\r\n# CLASS NOTES:\t\r\n- When we have assignments due, usually it's okay if we finish them in class. If we're not going to have any class time that day, Karen will try to let us know.\r\n\r\n- The official [HTML validator](https://validator.w3.org/) is linked on the home page of Canvas now for convenience\r\n\r\n- Can be helpful to look at the [course files](http://www.joelsklar.com/pwd6/) for the book too\r\n\r\n### MUSITES.ORG:\r\n- The dashboard for this is pretty similar to any other web hosting service you might want to use.\r\n- If you've got your page set up, you can go ahead and put it under public_html\r\n\t\r\n- __index.html and default.html are the two names you can use for a home page.__\r\n\r\n- This is set up like a server, so we can play around with it and there's a lot we can do with this.\r\n\t+ When you're tired of your HTML page, you can try what it looks like in here.",
